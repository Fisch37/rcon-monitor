# rcon-monitor

Rcon Monitor is a Work In Progress project with the goal of creating a web interface for viewing
and managing Minecraft servers. 
The main distinction is that this project will be fully vanilla using Minecraft's Remote Console
(Rcon) support.

Since the project is currently in its infancy, most features don't exist yet. Here's the roadmap:

1. ~~Receive and parse player data from the game~~
2. Create an HTTP-based API for accessing player data
3. Decompile Minecraft worlds and generate a region-based image map
4. Provide a pre-generated webpage to interact with the API using some kind of framework


Contributions to this project are welcome
